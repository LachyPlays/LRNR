# LRNR

## What is this?

This is a platform for education institutes to be able to post timetables, coursework,
messages students etc. As students who have to work with crappy software that tries to
do this job but fails miserably, we used our pain points and through this project
will attempt to remedy them.

## How do I run it?

You'll need to download [python3](https://www.python.org/) and
pip, which should come with your python installation. Once installed,
you will need to install [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/).
Once all that is installed and working, clone the repository and cd into the project
root. Then, run these commands:

`
cd lrnrsite && pipenv run python Main.py
`

This will start a local server on your machine, in debug mode.
